# Speech to Text for Transcription Services

This project provides a simple yet effective pipeline for converting speech audio files into text transcriptions using automatic speech recognition (ASR) techniques. It is intended for transcription services that process audio inputs such as interviews, podcasts, meetings, or lectures.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `project_1_Speech_to_Text_for_transcription_services.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete workflow for preprocessing audio, performing speech-to-text conversion, and displaying results.

## 🚀 Features

- Load and preprocess audio files (e.g., WAV, MP3)
- Use pre-trained ASR models for transcription (e.g., from Hugging Face or OpenAI Whisper)
- Display and optionally save transcribed text
- Basic error handling and audio visualization

## 🛠️ Dependencies

Make sure you have the following packages installed:

```bash
pip install torch torchaudio transformers librosa numpy matplotlib ipywidgets
```

If you're using Whisper:

```bash
pip install openai-whisper
```

## 📌 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the notebook `project_1_Speech_to_Text_for_transcription_services.ipynb`.
3. Upload your audio files and run the cells step-by-step.
4. View the transcriptions and optionally export them.

## 🔍 Example Output

Input: `interview.wav`  
Output:
```
Speaker 1: Welcome to the podcast.  
Speaker 2: Thank you for having me.
```
